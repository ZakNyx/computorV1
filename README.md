# Computorv1

`Computorv1` is a 1337 project that solves polynomial equations of degrees up to 2 using the discriminant method. This tool takes an equation in the form of a string and processes it to output the reduced form and its solutions (if they exist).

## Features

- Parses and reduces polynomial equations of degrees up to 2.
- Handles linear equations (degree 1) and quadratic equations (degree 2).
- Uses the discriminant to determine if the solutions are real, complex, or if no solution exists.
- Provides reduced forms of equations for clarity.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** must be installed on your machine.

### Required Python Libraries

The project relies on Python's **standard libraries** such as:

- `re`: For regular expression parsing.
- `math`: For mathematical operations (square root, etc.).

No external libraries are required for this version.

## How to Run

### Step 1: Clone or Download the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/computorv1.git
cd computorv1
```
